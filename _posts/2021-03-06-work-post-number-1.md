<span class="smallcaps"> I have always had a passion for typography.</span> I've loved the way that letters look, so in school I took the opportunity to develop a font of my own. <!-- excerpt -->Nitrogen is actally the second font that I made. 


### Blear
My first font was a project called *Blear*, which was a small font I made to get used to using FontForge for developing fonts. And when I say small, I mean small; *Blear* was a raster font that was 3 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall. Being so small it was nearly impossible to read, but it was never really meant to be read. I made the font so small so that it would be super easy to make glyphs so that I could quickly get into finalizing a font. This gave me the opportunity to work with FontForge's kerning and exporting tools.
