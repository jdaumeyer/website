                <p><span class="smallcaps"> I have always had a passion for typography.</span> I’ve loved the way that letters look, so in school I took the opportunity to develop a font of my own. <!-- excerpt -->Nitrogen is actally the second font that I made.</p>

<h3 id="blear">Blear</h3>
<p>My first font was a project called <em>Blear</em>, which was a small font I made to get used to using FontForge for developing fonts. And when I say small, I mean small; <em>Blear</em> was a raster font that was 3 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall. Being so small it was nearly impossible to read, but it was never really meant to be read. I made the font so small so that it would be super easy to make glyphs so that I could quickly get into finalizing a font. This gave me the opportunity to work with FontForge’s kerning and exporting tools. In that way it was a success and it was a lot of fun to work on. If you want to check it out, which I wouldn’t recomend actually using it, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/modernTypewritter/blear">Github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="nitrogen">Nitrogen</h3>
<p><em>Nitrogen</em> was the first font that I made with the idea of it being an actual font. I started off with drawing out some initial sketches on paper although sadly I have since lost them. What came out of those sketches was a Geometric Sans-serif font. The basis for the font was a lowercase letter ‘n’ that I drew. The curved shape and left running terminal became a motif for the rest of the font. This ‘n’ then became the reason I named the font ‘Nitrogen’. After making the ‘n’, I began making vector illustrations of other letters.</p>

<p>These started out as rough skecthes as I draged around shapes experimenting with different letter forms. This is when I learned that the process of desinging a font is extremely iterative. It is a constant fight between several aspects, readability, style, uniquness and consistency. Every gylph is a balance of this attributes and the only way to achieve this balance is by trial and error. However, in <em>Nitrogen</em>, some of these glyphs don’t have a great balance in my opinion. These are glyphs that if I were to go back and work on the font again, I would most certainly change. These glyphs are mainly the ‘z’ and ‘s’, I feel that I gave too much into the sharp design of <em>Nitrogen</em> with them and they’ve suffered from it.</p>

<p>However despite its roughness, <em>Nitrogen</em> is still a project I am very proud of. It was my first time creating a vector font and that definitely shows, but I still looks good. If you want to check it out, files for it can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/modernTypewritter/nitro">Github</a> as well.</p>
